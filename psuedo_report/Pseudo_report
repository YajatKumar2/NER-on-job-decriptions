Showing about our schema:
We designed a fine-grained label schema focusing on information that recruiters and applicants care about, such as job title,
required skills, education, experience, compensation, and benefits.

Baseline 1 — All-O Model:
As expected, a trivial model that predicts only the “O” label achieves an accuracy biased by the high frequency of non-entity tokens.
Precision, recall, and F1 for all entity labels are 0 since the model never predicts any entities.
Seqeval issues an UndefinedMetricWarning for labels with no predicted samples, which is expected in this baseline.
