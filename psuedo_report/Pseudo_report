Showing about our schema:
We designed a fine-grained label schema focusing on information that recruiters and applicants care about, such as job title,
required skills, education, experience, compensation, and benefits.

Baseline 1 — All-O Model:
As expected, a trivial model that predicts only the “O” label achieves an accuracy biased by the high frequency of non-entity tokens.
Precision, recall, and F1 for all entity labels are 0 since the model never predicts any entities.
Seqeval issues an UndefinedMetricWarning for labels with no predicted samples, which is expected in this baseline.

After Baseline 3
Where this fits in your project
Put all this code in notebooks/02_baselines.ipynb, in a section called
### Baseline 3 – Rule-based NER.
In your report, describe it as:
A gazetteer-based baseline using curated lists (job titles, skills, tools, etc.).
Longest-match-first phrase matching with BIO tags.

Progress Report: NER on Job Descriptions (Up to Baseline 3)
1. Environment Setup
To ensure a consistent and reproducible development environment, all required libraries were installed
inside a dedicated Jupyter Notebook kernel. This prevents mismatches between system Python and Jupyter’s Python environment.
The following libraries were installed:
spaCy (for pretrained NER baseline)
Transformers & datasets (for upcoming model fine-tuning)
seqeval (for NER evaluation)
pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for data handling and visuals)
Example installation cell:
!pip install spacy
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
!pip install transformers datasets seqeval pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
This step ensures the project is ready for training NER models and evaluating them consistently.
2. Project Structure Setup
A clean modular directory was created:
job_ner_project/
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                # Original job descriptions (20)
│   └── annotated/          # Labeled BIO-format dataset
│
├── notebooks/              # For exploration & model development
├── models/                 # Saved baseline & trained model files
├── reports/                # Final project report, plots, summaries
└── src/                    # Python scripts for training & evaluation
This structure helps keep raw data, annotations, notebooks, scripts, and models neatly separated.
3. Dataset Collection
A dataset of 20 job descriptions was created to represent real-world postings across multiple companies, job titles,
technologies, and locations.
Each job description was saved as:
data/raw/jd_001.txt
data/raw/jd_002.txt
...
data/raw/jd_020.txt
This forms the raw corpus on which the NER model operates.
4. Manual Annotation (BIO Format)
To build a supervised NER model, manual annotations were required.
This was done using a custom fine-grained label schema:
JOB_TITLE
COMPANY
LOCATION
EMPLOYEMENT_TYPE
SKILL_TECH
PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE
FRAMEWORK
TOOL
EDUCATION_LEVEL
DEGREE_MAJOR
Each job description was tokenized and labeled using the BIO tagging scheme:
B-LABEL → beginning of the entity
I-LABEL → inside the entity
O → outside any entity
I generated a complete, consistent annotation for all 20 job descriptions and compiled them into:
data/annotated/job_ner_annotations_full_20_jds.csv
This CSV is the core training dataset for everything moving forward.
5. Data Preparation Inside Notebook
Inside 02_baselines.ipynb, the annotated CSV was loaded:
df = pd.read_csv("data/annotated/job_ner_annotations_full_20_jds.csv")
Then the rows were grouped by sentence_id so each job description becomes one labeled sequence:
sentences_tokens = []
sentences_labels = []

for sent_id, group in df.groupby("sentence_id"):
    sentences_tokens.append(group["token"].tolist())
    sentences_labels.append(group["label"].tolist())
A simple 80/20 train-test split was performed:
First 16 job descriptions → train
Last 4 job descriptions → test
6. Baseline 1 — All-O Model
The simplest possible NER model predicts O for every token.
Purpose:
To create a “worst-case baseline” that highlights the difficulty of the task.
Implementation:
pred_all_o = [["O"] * len(seq) for seq in test_tokens]
print(classification_report(test_labels, pred_all_o))
Results:
Precision, recall, and F1 for all entity types = 0
seqeval correctly raised UndefinedMetricWarning (expected)
Serves as reference for evaluating better models
7. Baseline 2 — Pretrained spaCy NER
We evaluated spaCy’s en_core_web_sm model, which is trained on general-purpose text (news, web data) and not job descriptions.
Steps performed:
Loaded spaCy model
Loaded raw job descriptions
Ran spaCy to extract ORG, GPE, and LOC
Mapped them to our schema:
ORG → COMPANY
GPE / LOC → LOCATION
Converted spaCy outputs to BIO tags aligned with tokens
Evaluated using seqeval
Expected outcome:
Detects some companies and locations correctly
Performs poorly on job-specific labels like JOB_TITLE, TOOL, etc.
This provides a realistic pretrained baseline.
8. Baseline 3 — Rule-Based NER
We built a rule-based system using:
Keyword lists (gazetteers)
Longest-match-first phrase matching
Defined dictionaries for:
job titles
companies
locations
tools
frameworks
programming languages
technical skills
degrees
education levels
Example:
job_titles = {"data scientist", "software engineer", ...}
programming_languages = {"python", "java", "kotlin", ...}
tools = {"sql", "excel", "docker", ...}
A conversion map was created:
phrase2label["data scientist"] = "JOB_TITLE"
phrase2label["sql"] = "TOOL"
...
The rule-based tagging function applied greedy longest-match tagging:
labels = rule_based_tag(tokens)
Evaluation on the test set showed:
Better performance than All-O and spaCy baselines
Successfully detects many tools, languages, frameworks
Missing some ambiguous or multi-word entities
This makes it a strong baseline before training machine-learning models.
