So we need plan a project, in which we design a domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) system 
for job descriptions that extracts a rich set of entities useful for HR and recruitment applications.

Text needed for Intro:
Job descriptions contain a lot of unstructured text describing roles, skills, experience, salary, and benefits. 
Human recruiters or automated systems need structured information (title, company, skills, years of experience, etc.) 
to match candidates, analyze the job market, and build recommendation systems.
In this project, we design a domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) system for job descriptions 
that extracts a rich set of entities useful for HR and recruitment applications.
